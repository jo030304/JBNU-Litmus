I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore codebases and design implementation plans.\n\nI can see I'm in a git repository at `/home/ubuntu` on the main branch. The recent commits suggest this is a project with features like plagiarism checking, profile filters, compile error design, and vision capabilities.\n\nI'm in **READ-ONLY mode**, which means I can:\n- Explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read tools\n- Use bash for read-only commands (ls, cat, git log, find, etc.)\n- Design and plan implementations\n- Analyze code structure and patterns\n\nI **cannot** modify, create, or delete any files.\n\nWhat would you like me to help you with? Please share:\n1. The requirements for what you'd like to implement\n2. Any specific perspective or approach you'd like me to take in the design process\n\nI'll then thoroughly explore the codebase and provide you with a detailed implementation plan!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1062,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1062,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":217,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXJBpLmnHTJMBavq1iza4","type":"assistant","uuid":"60afa0d1-64d1-4849-8223-ac2382024269","timestamp":"2026-01-20T06:51:47.543Z"}
