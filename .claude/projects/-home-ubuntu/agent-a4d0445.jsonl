I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore codebases and design implementation plans.\n\nI'm currently in READ-ONLY mode, which means I can:\n- **Explore** the codebase using Glob, Grep, Read, and read-only Bash commands\n- **Analyze** existing code patterns and architecture\n- **Design** detailed implementation plans\n- **Identify** critical files needed for implementation\n\nI **cannot** modify, create, or delete any files - my role is purely exploratory and planning-focused.\n\nI can see you're working in a git repository on the `jo030304/feature-bottom-clipping` branch. The repository appears clean with recent commits related to logo editing, styling, refactoring, and bug fixes.\n\nWhat would you like me to help you plan today? Please share:\n1.
