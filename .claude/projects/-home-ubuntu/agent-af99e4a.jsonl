I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore and plan for your codebase.\n\nI can see you're working on a branch called `jo030304/feature-Add-CompileError-Design` and the most recent commit mentions adding a compile error design and fixing an issue with viewing one's own source code.\n\nI'm in **READ-ONLY planning mode**, which means I can:\n- Explore your codebase using Read, Glob, and Grep\n- Analyze existing code patterns and architecture\n- Design implementation plans based on requirements\n- Provide detailed step-by-step strategies\n\nI **cannot** modify, create, or delete any files.\n\nWhat would you like me to help you plan or explore today? For example:\n- Review the recent compile error design implementation\n- Plan improvements or new features\n- Analyze code patterns and architecture\n- Design solutions for specific requirements\n\nPlease share your requirements or what you'd like me to focus on!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1053,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1053,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXAZW4iArdEtyXQtR6vup","type":"assistant","uuid":"dc8ec7f0-12b5-49e3-8237-cc02406005ec","timestamp":"2026-01-16T06:11:24.197Z"}
