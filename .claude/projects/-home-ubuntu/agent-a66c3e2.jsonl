I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore and plan implementations for this codebase.\n\nI can see we're working in a git repository on the branch `jo030304/feature-bottom-clipping`. The repository appears to be clean with recent commits related to various features including logo edits, font sizes, ticket removal, and comment functionality.\n\nI'm in **READ-ONLY planning mode**, which means I can:\n- ✅ Explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read tools\n- ✅ Run read-only bash commands (ls, cat, git log, find, etc.)\n- ✅ Analyze code structure and patterns\n- ✅ Design implementation plans\n\nBut I **cannot**:\n- ❌ Create, modify, or delete any files\n- ❌ Run commands that change system state\n- ❌ Use file editing tools\n\nWhat would you like me to help you plan or explore? Please share:\n1. The requirements or features you'd like me to design\n2. Any specific perspective or approach you'd like me to take\n3. Any files or areas of the codebase I should focus on\n\nI'm ready to dive in and create a detailed implementation plan for you!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1026,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1026,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CX6mwF2ro9gX7VDxTcezA","type":"assistant","uuid":"a705419f-e2fe-4ed7-8909-40706a5f7346","timestamp":"2026-01-14T06:12:05.788Z"}
